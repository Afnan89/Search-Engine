    "### Algorithm Design Goals and Considerations\n",
    "The goal of our algorithm is to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes in a straightforward, simple, easy to read pair of nested loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementaion of the algorithm uses these steps:\n",
    "1. create a python list of all integers between 2 (the smallest prime number) and *N*\n",
    "1. calculate the stopping point, which is the ceiling of the square root of *N*\n",
    "1. start with the first number in the list\n",
    "1. check to see if we have reached the stopping point, else loop through each successive element remaining in the list until we reach the stopping point.  Call this list element our Current Prime Factor (CPF).\n",
    "1. with the inner loop, we move backwards from the end of the list until we reach our CPF element.  Call this backwards moving list element our Target\n",
    "1. check to see if the CPF divides evenly into the Target.  If it does, then remove the Target from the list (since it is an even multiple of the CPF)\n",
    "1. advance to the next CPF in the list (the next CPF is a prime number)\n",
    "1. Lather, rinse, and repeat until the stopping point is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have a mathmetician in our group, we know that you can stop your search for primes once you have reached $\\sqrt{N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose a list as the fundamental data structure because it is one of the simplest Python data types, and is easy to manipulate for adding elements to the list (creating the initial list of integers between 2 and *N*, as well as removing elements from anywhere inside list which are multiples of the primes numbers the algorithm finds).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts by using the CPFs from the beginning of the list because that is the direction from which you get the biggest bang for the buck.  That is, eliminating all the mutliples of 2 from the list cuts the list in half, and then the multiples of 3's cuts the list by another 1/3;  working from the end of the list would have the list impact on the list length, and would also require a priori knowledge of the prime factors.  Thus, each pass through the list requires fewer (or the same, if no Targets were eliminated) computations than the prior pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "We eliminate the Target elements from the end of the list because when a list member is removed from a list, the indices for all elements deeper in the list then change.  Trying to sequence forward through a list with changing indices requires much more bookkeeping to keep where you are in the list straight than when you move backwards through the list (all the index changes occur behind you deeper in the list while you move to the shallow end of the list and remain unaffected by those index changes)."

    "1. The first instance where PT is evenly divisible by a CN, we know that PT is not prime so we can stop and move to the next integer number in above the current PT\n",
    "1. Increment the PT by one and keep looping until we find a PT that is not evenly divisible by any CN\n",
    "1. If we exahust our list of CN's and none of them result in an evenly divisible result, we have discovered a prime number, so we can break from our loop and report the result to the calling function\n",

    "The primary difference in speed between the two algorithms is that the Sieve must calculate every single prime in the desired range, whereas the generator is only calculating the next value in the sequence.  This means that the Sieve generates a list of all numbers between 1 and *N* and it touches ever single last number in the sequence and does so multiple times for many of those numbers.  In addition, traversing a list is time consuming versus dealing with a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the generator, it performs, on average, fewer calculations per number.  For example, for all even numbers, it performs the calculation exactly once: Even_Target_Number / 2 leaves no remainder, done with check go to next Target Number.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, at the low end, there is not a significant difference in performance between the two algorithms when it comes to terms of human perception.  That is, a human can't tell the difference between a response time of 0.006 msec and 0.05 msec--only if you run the program several thousand times or more would a human be able to begin to notice a difference in performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, it would be reasonable to implement the prime number generator function only and be content with the results for most practical applications.\n",
    "\n",

Since there are no primes to be found beyond *N*, there is no need to check past *N*.  We leave this modification as an exercise for the reader.\n"
